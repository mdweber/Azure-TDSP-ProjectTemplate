# Project Charter

## Business background

* Who is the client, what business domain the client is in.
* What business problems are we trying to address?

## Scope
* What data science solutions are we trying to build? OR What is the research question(s)?
* What will we do or how will we answer?
* How is it going to be consumed by the customer?
* What is out of scope.
* Limitations and constraints.

## Personnel
* Who are on this project:
	* ELT Sponsor

## Metrics
* What are the qualitative objectives? (e.g. reduce user churn)
* What is a quantifiable metric  (e.g. reduce the fraction of users with 4-week inactivity)
* Quantify what improvement in the values of the metrics are useful for the customer scenario (e.g. reduce the  fraction of users with 4-week inactivity by 20%) 
* What is the baseline (current) value of the metric? (e.g. current fraction of users with 4-week inactivity = 60%)
* How will we measure the metric? (e.g. A/B test on a specified subset for a specified period; or comparison of performance after implementation to baseline)

## Plan
* Phases (milestones), timeline, short description of what we'll do in each phase.

## Architecture and Ops
* Data
  * What data do we expect? Raw data in the customer data sources (e.g. on-prem files, SQL, on-prem Hadoop etc.)

* Analytics and DveOps
  * Hardware
  * Software

* How do we operationalize
  * How will the customer use the model results to make decisions
  * Data movement pipeline in production
  * Make a 1 slide diagram showing the end to end data flow and decision architecture

## Communication
* How will we keep in touch? Weekly meetings?
